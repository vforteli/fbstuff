Open file in browser and input a string. Click dostuff to get length, number of words and the string reversed.
The definition of a word is one or more characters separated by a white space. Consecutive white spaces are not counted.
White space in beginning and end will not be included. This is a feature :=)

The length includes white space, but not white space in the beginning or end.
Therefore the reverse string will also not include white space in the beginning or end.
